## Goals:

- Snap: Press space to start play
- Movement: Use arrow keys to move the ball carrier
- Passing: If the ball carrier is the QB, press space to throw the ball towards the mouse pointer
- Catching: If the ball collides with a receiver or defender, they catch it
- Tackling: If a defender collides with the ball carrier, the play ends
- Possession: Ball starts on the 20 yard line for each possession
- No kickoffs, no first downs: just try to score
- After play: Reset for the next possession
- WRs run specific routes, cornerbacks try to stay close to WR
- Defensive line engages nearest blocker and tries to break through to the ball carrier
