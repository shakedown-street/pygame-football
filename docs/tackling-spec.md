Tackle spec

When a defender collides with the ball carrier, they become "engaged" until the tackle attempt is resolved. During this time movement for both players should be restricted, simulating the struggle of a tackle attempt. During the engagement, factors such as velocity, strength, tackle, break tackle, and hit power, should influence the outcome of the tackle attempt. A strong, fast moving defender with a high tackle and hit power should have a higher chance of successfully bringing down the ball carrier, while a strong, fast moving ball carrier with a high break tackle should have a better chance of breaking free. The outcome should be determined by a combination of these factors, possibly using a weighted random chance system to simulate the unpredictability of real-life tackles. After the tackle attempt is resolved and results in a broken tackle, both players should be released from the engagement, allowing them to move freely again, but the defender should have a short cooldown period before they can attempt another tackle.

Upon first collision, a roll should be tacken based off the above factors to determine if engagement should even occur. If the roll succeeds, the ball carrier breaks free immediately and takes the defender out of play (truck mechanic).
